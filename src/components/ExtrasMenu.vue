        "I truly hope you like it. I certainly enjoyed making it for you, even though it made me cry on several occasions.<br><br>" +

        "Going through my photos and videos of us brought me back to all the memories weâ€™ve sharedâ€”the times I annoyed you, " +

        "No matter what happens in the future, I will always cherish the time we spent together, " +

        "took some adorable pictures, and then visited that arcade (the name escapes me) where we won that Minnie and Mickey Mouse toy. " +
        "That was a good dayâ€”I was really happy then.<br><br>" +

        "I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ve ever told you this, but I often think about the time we were sitting on your couch, " +
        "and you told me how your brain worksâ€”how you analyze words with numbers, turning people's names into special numbers. " +
        "If they donâ€™t fit into one, itâ€™s a bad sign. (I probably canâ€™t explain it properly, but I assume you know what I mean.)<br><br>" +
